## Remarks
1. The notebook cells connecting to Colab have been converted to markdown cells as we ran the entire notebook on our local GPUs.
2. The overfitting models have been excluded from the submission as they cause the size of the submission .zip file to exceed the available limit of 100MB. The overfitting models can be separately sent via email in case of further request.
