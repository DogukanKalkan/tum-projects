# Submission Notes

1. The `exercise_3.zip` file contains all the submission files **except** the best model for part **3.1. 3D-EPN**.
2. The files `model_best_ckpt.zip` and the corresponding `.z1` and `.z2` files contain the best model for part **3.1. 3D-EPN**.
2. Since the training times were extremely long for our own GPU, we had to run the trainings on separate times. Therefore, the submitted notebook does not contain the output for the model trainings. Please feel free to check out the training log output for part 3.2.
